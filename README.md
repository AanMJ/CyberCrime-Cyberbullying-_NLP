#**TinyBERT Fine-Tuning for Tweet Classification into various classes**

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a TinyBERT model for a multi-class text classification task. The dataset used consists of preprocessed tweets, and the goal is to classify these tweets into one of six categories: Age, Ethnicity, Gender, Not Cyberbullying, Other Cyberbullying, and Religion.

TinyBERT, a lightweight version of the BERT model, was selected to demonstrate that smaller models can achieve competitive performance on classification tasks while being more resource-efficient compared to larger models like BERT and RoBERTa.
